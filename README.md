# CodeAlpha Internship Projects

This repository contains three projects completed as part of the CodeAlpha internship. Each project applies machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Table of Contents
Project 1: Credit Scoring
Project 2: Disease Prediction
Project 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

## Project 1: Credit Scoring
This project evaluates the creditworthiness of individuals using machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether a person is likely to default based on financial history and other factors.

### Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Training models for credit risk assessment.
- Evaluation of model performance.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

---

## Project 2: Disease Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having a certain disease based on given symptoms using machine learning models.

### Features:
- Symptom-based disease classification.
- Data preprocessing and model training.
- GUI implementation (if applicable).

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Tkinter (if GUI is implemented)

---

## Project 3: Handwritten Character Recognition
This project classifies handwritten characters (A-Z, 0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset used is the **A-Z and 0-9 dataset** from Kaggle.

### Features:
- Trains a CNN model to recognize handwritten characters.
- Uses Tkinter for a GUI interface to draw and classify characters in real time.
- Preprocessing of image data for model training.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
