Project 1: Credit Scoring

This project aims to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals using machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether a person is likely to default based on financial history and other factors.

Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Training models for credit risk assessment.

Evaluation of model performance.

Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Project 2: Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person having a certain disease based on given symptoms.

Features:

Symptom-based disease classification.

Data preprocessing and model training.

GUI implementation (if applicable).

Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Tkinter (if GUI is implemented)

Project 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

This project classifies handwritten characters (A-Z, 0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset used is the A-Z and 0-9 dataset from Kaggle.

Features:

Trains a CNN model to recognize handwritten characters.

Uses Tkinter for a GUI interface to draw and classify characters in real time.

Preprocessing of image data for model training.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

Tkinter

Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
